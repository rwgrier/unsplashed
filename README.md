# Charles Proxy Primer Blog Post

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rwgrier/unsplashed.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rwgrier/unsplashed)

This project is to be used with my blog post which is a primer on using Charles Proxy.

## How To Run

The project is in Swift 3 and on Xcode 8.x. 

In order to run the sample project, you'll need an Unsplash developer account and an Application ID. You can apply for one here: [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers). Once you have an Application ID, replace `[YOUR APPLICATION ID HERE]` on the line that says `let clientKey: String = "[YOUR APPLICATION ID HERE]"` in the `PhotoDataSource.swift` class file. 

Without the developer account and Application ID, the code will compile, but when you run the app, you won't see any results. Only an error.
